# NBT.js
An NBT parser written in and for JS. 
This project aims to be usable both on the server (Node.js and similar) and in the browser (Firefox, Chromium, Ladybird, etc.)

> [!NOTE]
> This project is immediately on effective hold, as I have many other things going on, but want to eventually port my [Python-based NBT parser](https://github.com/Lampe2020/nbt.git) to JavaScript. Feel free to open PRs if you want to help with the porting work.
